    "message": "Once upon a time, deep in the heart of the Whispering Woods, there lived a magical creature known to few—a pink owl with feathers as soft and vibrant as a sunset. Her name was Luma, and she was unlike any other owl, for her color wasn’t natural; it was enchanted. The story of her pink feathers was a mystery whispered among the trees and known only to those who believed in magic.",
